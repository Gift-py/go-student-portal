basically a software that has different student records, and you can view thw courses they're offerring.

there would be student table,
each student will have a {name, age, matric-number, level, courses they're offering}

courses: max of 5 

sooo
from postman we would be able to:
see all students    GetAllStudents
see a student       GetStudent
create a new student NewStudent
Delete a student    DeleteStudent
Update student data UpdateStudent

when creating a new student;
we must specify the courses
Matric Number should be used to identify (Key)

Routes for basic student information, and routes to view student course
Soo i guess we could make it so that we can create a student without specifying the courses that the student will
offer.

AddCourse   ultimately going to be a list (append the list of courses to the database)
RemoveCourse  one cocurse at a time.


student can only enroll from available courses .
